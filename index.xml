      <title>PSA: If delete `AnimationDurationFactor` if you have an old installation</title>
      <link>//chenbrian.ca/posts/2022/kwin_choppy_fix/</link>

      <description>As per title: Delete AnimationDurationFactor from ~/.config/kwinrc if you have an old installation. This overrides the default value in kdeglobals and for me caused my animation speed to get stuck at something stupid.
 source  Also, this is entirely anecdotal but it appears to me that setting KWIN_TRIPLE_BUFFER=0 in /etc/profile.d/kwin.sh to disable triple buffering results in smoother behaviour than with it on despite the typical recommendations online. This may be because my laptop runs a Intel UHD620 and two 4K displays and the puny little integrated graphics card can&amp;rsquo;t keep up with triple buffering.</description>

      <title>`LXD`, Arch Linux, ROS 2, and Wayland</title>

      <guid>//chenbrian.ca/posts/2022/lxd_arch_ros2_wayland/</guid>
      <description>Rationale: I started my internship at Open Robotics and I needed to get a development environment set up on my laptop and could not be arsed to set up an ubuntu partition (and I&amp;rsquo;m a little too bound to my current rat&amp;rsquo;s nest of config files). So, like any other rational being, I invested twice the time and effort than it would&amp;rsquo;ve taken to get an ubuntu partition running into using LXD to fire up something that would compile ROS 2 1.</description>

      <description>Turns out UofT students/faculty/etc can host a free personal site (50mb max) in individual.utoronto.ca. This process is also entirely undocumented.
 Claim it through UTORid management here Connect to it through a ftp client. If you go back into the UTORid info page it will tell you what address to use for ftp which looks something like ftp://yourutorid@individual.utoronto.ca I just used dolphin&amp;rsquo;s built in support for network drives to upload the files Upload files through ftp and enjoy!</description>

      <description>Back when I was still on X11 1 , I had this little bash script to toggle my touchscreen on/off since I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it all that often except to sign the occasional PDF, and it sucked up power2.

      <description>A few weeks back one of my roommates mentioned in passing that they were thinking of writing conway&amp;rsquo;s game of life as a little widget for their website. I thought that was pretty fun and suggested that it would be really neat if it were in 3D as well.
&amp;hellip;Anyways fast-forward about two hours and I was stuck in a 3-hour lecture. So I wrote it (as is pretty evident below)</description>

      <description>Needed to use a Pi Pico for one of my courses (which mandated circuitpython &amp;hellip; for reasons unknown) and noticed that Adafruit&amp;rsquo;s documentation for using CircuitPython with something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t Mu Editor was not really up to par.
 Install CircuitPython by copying .uf2 file into the Pi Pico, which can be done by just plugging it into your computer python3 -m pip install circuitpython-stubs to get completions with your LSP of choice Connect to serial port to view prints and logging info   find the appropriate port with ls /dev/ttyACM* connect using GNU screen or whatever you like to use  e.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;ndash; \( \LaTeX \)) is unequivocally cooler than Word. And you want an unequivocally cool resume as well.
So you tried altacv, but it always got absolutely chewed up by ATS systems.
And so you yearned for a 🌠cool🥶 single-column layout, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one.
I present: my fork of altacv with a few 🌟 revolutionary 🌟 features.
 Cut down on icons to improve pdf-to-text conversion Change to a single-column layout \itag{asdf} command to draw an inline &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; \chref command for hyperlinks Disabling word wrapping and hyphenation Various changes to \makecvevent, etc.</description>

 This, and an appreciation for elegant design (and the various types concrete aggregates used in the pantheon) is what has stuck from when I took CIV102. We were fortunate enough to be the last cohort to take it under Prof.</description>

      <title>Setting up JupyterHub with `c` kernel on raspberry pi and/or binder</title>
      <link>//chenbrian.ca/posts/2022/jupyterhub-rpi-binder/</link>

      <description>TLDR; I wanted to do something with this Raspberry Pi 4 I had lying around.
Figured I would try to get JupyterHub going on it, maybe with a c kernel for my students to use. Turns out there are a few issues getting jupyterhub built for ARMv7. Anyhow the primary thing is that the rust toolchain must be installed in order to build the cryptography python module, and that when installing in a docker container the --sys-prefix must be passed to install_c_kernel.</description>

      <description>Making it a commitment for 2022 to read some poems.
The Jackdaw source
William Cowper
There is a bird who, by his coat
And by the hoarseness of his note,
Might be supposed a crow;
A great frequenter of the church,
Where, bishop-like, he finds a perch,
And dormitory too.
Above the steeple shines a plate,
That turns and turns, to indicate
From what point blows the weather.
Look up &amp;ndash; your brains begin to swim,</description>

      <description>This is a work in progress
 LSP with clangd ROS2 puts its headers into /opt/ros2/&amp;lt;ROS_DISTRO&amp;gt;/include. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out of the box with my fairly default clangd setup, and it would be too easy if it just worked out of the box with vim! Most editors like vscode or clion have their own way of handling scenarios like this, e.g. vscode using a c_cpp_properties.json file.

I do not guarantee content correctness &amp;ndash; but if you find a mistake, please let me know!
