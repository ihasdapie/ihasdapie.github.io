      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;ndash; \( \LaTeX \)) is unequivocally cooler than Word. And you want an unequivocally cool resume as well.
So you tried altacv, but it always got absolutely chewed up by ATS systems.
And so you yearned for a ðŸŒ coolðŸ¥¶ single-column layout, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one.
I present: my fork of altacv with a few ðŸŒŸ revolutionary ðŸŒŸ features.
 Cut down on icons to improve pdf-to-text conversion Change to a single-column layout \itag{asdf} command to draw an inline &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; \chref command for hyperlinks Disabling word wrapping and hyphenation Various changes to \makecvevent, etc.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The only three rules an engineer needs to learn and remember&amp;rdquo;  \( F = ma \) You can&amp;rsquo;t push on a rope. To get the answer, you must first know the answer   Michael P. Collins
 This, and an appreciation for elegant design (and the various types concrete aggregates used in the pantheon) is what has stuck from when I took CIV102. We were fortunate enough to be the last cohort to take it under Prof.</description>

      <title>Setting up JupyterHub with `c` kernel on raspberry pi and/or binder</title>
      <link>//chenbrian.ca/posts/2022/jupyterhub-rpi-binder/</link>

      <description>TLDR; I wanted to do something with this Raspberry Pi 4 I had lying around.
Figured I would try to get JupyterHub going on it, maybe with a c kernel for my students to use. Turns out there are a few issues getting jupyterhub built for ARMv7. Anyhow the primary thing is that the rust toolchain must be installed in order to build the cryptography python module, and that when installing in a docker container the --sys-prefix must be passed to install_c_kernel.</description>

There is a bird who, by his coat
And by the hoarseness of his note,
Might be supposed a crow;
A great frequenter of the church,
Where, bishop-like, he finds a perch,
And dormitory too.
Above the steeple shines a plate,
That turns and turns, to indicate</description>

      <title>Using NeoVim for ROS2 c&#43;&#43; development</title>

      <description>Using clangd ROS2 puts its headers into a rather non-standard location, /opt/ros2/&amp;lt;ROS_DISTRO&amp;gt;/include. Obviously this doesn&amp;rsquo;t play well with standard clangd setups, and it would be too easy if it just worked out of the box with vim! Most editors like vscode or clion have their own way of handling scenarios like this, e.g. vscode using a c_cpp_properties.json file.
 For vscode setup, see this or this
 With vim this is as little uglier.</description>

      <description>Deploying your personal website onto github pages is so 2013. Why avoid the hassle of self-hosting with a static site generator and server? Why not just use something tried and tested by the community?
It&amp;rsquo;s just not as fun &amp;hellip; and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like studying for a final one afternoon.
So here&amp;rsquo;s a simple 111-line golang webserver that you can use to deploy your personal website.
