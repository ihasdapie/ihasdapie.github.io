      <description>Table of Contents   The Jackdaw Echolalia     Making it a commitment for 2022 to read some poems.
The Jackdaw William Cowper

There is a bird who, by his coat
And by the hoarseness of his note,
Might be supposed a crow;
A great frequenter of the church,

      <description>Using clangd ROS2 puts its headers into a rather non-standard location, /opt/ros2/&amp;lt;ROS_DISTRO&amp;gt;/include. Obviously this doesn&amp;rsquo;t play well with standard clangd setups, and it would be too easy if it just worked out of the box with vim! Most editors like vscode or clion have their own way of handling scenarios like this, e.g. vscode using a c_cpp_properties.json file.
 For vscode setup, see this or this
 With vim this is as little uglier.</description>

      <description>Exam &amp;lsquo;cheat sheets&amp;rsquo; for EngSci 2nd year semester fall semester. These were made as part of my own studying for the exams. As 3/6 of my exams were cancelled due to the omicron covid variant, AER210, MAT292, and PHY293 are missing.

      <description>Deploying your personal website onto github pages is so 2013. Why avoid the hassle of self-hosting with a static site generator and server? Why not just use something tried and tested by the community?
It&amp;rsquo;s just not as fun &amp;hellip; and I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel like studying for a final one afternoon.
So here&amp;rsquo;s a simple 111-line golang webserver that you can use to deploy your personal website.
There&amp;rsquo;s also some cute figlet art</description>
