<h2 id="the-jackdaw">The Jackdaw</h2>
<p><a href="https://allpoetry.com/The-Jackdaw">source</a></p>
<p><strong>William Cowper</strong></p>
<p>There is a bird who, by his coat<br>
And by the hoarseness of his note,<br>
Might be supposed a crow;<br>
A great frequenter of the church,<br>
Where, bishop-like, he finds a perch,<br>
And dormitory too.</p>
<p>Above the steeple shines a plate,<br>
That turns and turns, to indicate<br>
From what point blows the weather.<br>
Look up &ndash; your brains begin to swim,<br>
&lsquo;Tis in the clouds &ndash; that pleases him,<br>
He chooses it the rather.</p>
<p>Fond of the speculative height,<br>
Thither he wings his airy flight,<br>
And thence securely sees<br>
The bustle and the rareeshow,<br>
That occupy mankind below,<br>
Secure and at his ease.</p>
<p>You think, no doubt, he sits and muses<br>
On future broken bones and bruises,<br>
If he should chance to fall.<br>
No; not a single thought like that<br>
Employs his philosophic pate,<br>
Or troubles it at all.</p>
<p>He sees that this great roundabout,<br>
The world, with all its motley rout,<br>
Church, army, physic, law,<br>
Its customs and its businesses,<br>
Is no concern at all of his,<br>
And says &ndash; what says he? &ndash; Caw.</p>
<p>Thrice happy bird! I too have seen<br>
Much of the vanities of men;<br>
And, sick of having seen &lsquo;em,<br>
Would cheerfully these limbs resign<br>
For such a pair of wings as thine<br>
And such a head between &lsquo;em.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s something about the cadence and imagery here that makes this one so enthralling.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Ian Williams</strong></p>
<p>Once one gets what one wants<br>
one no longer wants it.</p>
<p>One no longer wants what?</p>
<p>One no longer wants what<br>
one wanted.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>A man and a woman want a woman and a man<br>
or a man and a woman depending<br>
on the man and the woman.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Once one gets what one wants once<br>
one no longer wants it once</p>
<p>then one no longer wants it at all.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Yes then no. Yes and no? No.<br>
Yes then no then yes and always<br>
after yes comes no. Never always<br>
yes, but always no. Always know<br>
after yes comes no.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>One wants what one wants<br>
not what one wanted.</p>
<h2 id="ozymandias">Ozymandias</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/46565/ozymandias">source</a></p>
<p><strong>Percy Shelley</strong></p>
<p>I met a traveller from an antique land,<br>
Who said—“Two vast and trunkless legs of stone<br>
Stand in the desert. . . . Near them, on the sand,<br>
Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read<br>
Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,<br>
The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed;<br>
And on the pedestal, these words appear:<br>
My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings;<br>
Look on my Works, ye Mighty, and despair!<br>
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay<br>
Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare<br>
The lone and level sands stretch far away.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, this was also the title of the <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2301451/?ref_=tt_eps_top">legendary breaking bad episode</a>.<br>
But where are his works? Ozymandias &ndash; is now but two broken legs in the desert which &ldquo;stretch far away&rdquo;.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="love">Love</h2>

<strong>Tina Chang</strong></p>
<p>I am haunted by how much our mothers do not know. <br>
How a republic falls because of its backhanded deals,<br>
stairwell secrets. My mother does not know I am lying<br>
with a man who is darker than me, that we do not<br>
have names for how we truly treat our bodies.<br>
What we do with them. The other possesses me.<br>
Without him the perception of me fails to exist.<br>
My mother now is taking her sheers and cutting<br>
through live shrimp. When I was a child she peeled<br>
each flushed grape until only the pale fleshy bead<br>
remained. She placed them onto a plate in one shining<br>
mound, deseeded, in front of me. How I sucked and bled<br>
the fruit of all their juice, hypnotized in front of the buzz<br>
of television in each version of my childhood. I am<br>
her daughter. This is certain. I am lying down with a man<br>
who is darker than me and maybe this poem is my<br>
real republic, my face is my face, or is it stolen from<br>
my mother and hung over mine? If I were a dream<br>
you could say my countenance was a string of flickering lights<br>
made of teeth or an expression unraveling like a carpet<br>
into a narrow river of another life. Does truth matter<br>
when it&rsquo;s floating face up or face down?<br>
The answer to this makes all the difference.</p>

<strong>Randall Mann</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is just an excerpt from it I enjoyed</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain sadness to this body of water<br>
adjacent to the runway, its reeds and weeds,<br>
handful of ducks, the water color</p>
<p>manmade. A still life. And still<br>
life&rsquo;s a cold exercise in looking back,<br>
back to Florida, craning my neck</p>
<p>like a sandhill crane in Alachua Basin.<br>
As for the scrub oaks,<br>
the hot wind in the leaves was language,</p>
<h2 id="vivas-to-those-who-have-failed-the-paterson-silk-strike-1913">Vivas To Those Who Have Failed: The Paterson Silk Strike, 1913</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/58738/vivas-to-those-who-have-failed-the-paterson-silk-strike-1913">source</a><br>
<strong>Martín Espada</strong></p>
<p>Vivas to those who have fail&rsquo;d!<br>
And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!<br>
And to those themselves who sank in the sea!<br>
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!<br>
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!<br>
—Walt Whitman</p>
<p><em>I. The Red Flag</em></p>
<p>The newspapers said the strikers would hoist<br>
the red flag of anarchy over the silk mills<br>
of Paterson. At the strike meeting, a dyers&rsquo; helper<br>
from Naples rose as if from the steam of his labor,<br>
lifted up  his hand and said here is the red flag:<br>
brightly stained with dye for the silk of bow ties<br>
and scarves, the skin and fingernails boiled away<br>
for six dollars a week in the dye house.</p>
<p>He sat down without another word, sank back<br>
into the fumes, name and face rubbed off<br>
by oblivion&rsquo;s thumb like a Roman coin<br>
from the earth of his birthplace dug up<br>
after a thousand years, as the strikers<br>
shouted the only praise he would ever hear.</p>
<p><em>II. The River Floods the Avenue</em></p>
<p>He was the other Valentino, not the romantic sheik<br>
and bullfighter of silent movie palaces who died too young,<br>
but the Valentino standing on his stoop to watch detectives<br>
hired by the company bully strikebreakers onto a trolley<br>
and a chorus of strikers bellowing the banned word scab.<br>
He was not a striker or a scab, but the bullet fired to scatter<br>
the crowd pulled the cork in the wine barrel of Valentino&rsquo;s back.<br>
His body, pale as the wings of a moth, lay beside his big-bellied wife.</p>
<p>Two white-veiled horses pulled the carriage to the cemetery.<br>
Twenty thousand strikers walked behind the hearse, flooding<br>
the avenue like the river that lit up the mills, surging around<br>
the tombstones. Blood for blood, cried Tresca: at this signal,<br>
thousands of hands dropped red carnations and ribbons<br>
into the grave, till the coffin evaporated in a red sea.</p>
<p><em>III. The Insects in the Soup</em></p>
<p>Reed was a Harvard man. He wrote for the New York magazines.<br>
Big Bill, the organizer, fixed his good eye on Reed and told him<br>
of the strike. He stood on a tenement porch across from the mill<br>
to escape the rain and listen to the weavers. The bluecoats<br>
told him to move on. The Harvard man asked for a name to go<br>
with the number on the badge, and the cops tried to unscrew<br>
his arms from their sockets. When the judge asked his business,<br>
Reed said: Poet. The judge said: Twenty days in the county jail.</p>
<p>Reed was a Harvard man. He taught the strikers Harvard songs,<br>
the tunes to sing with rebel words at the gates of the mill. The strikers<br>
taught him how to spot the insects in the soup, speaking in tongues<br>
the gospel of One Big Union and the eight-hour day, cramming the jail<br>
till the weary jailers had to unlock the doors. Reed would write:<br>
There&rsquo;s war in Paterson. After it was over, he rode with Pancho Villa.</p>
<p><em>IV. The Little Agitator</em></p>
<p>The cops on horseback charged into the picket line.<br>
The weavers raised their hands across their faces,<br>
hands that knew the loom as their fathers&rsquo; hands<br>
knew the loom, and the billy clubs broke their fingers.<br>
Hannah was seventeen, the captain of the picket line,<br>
the Joan of Arc of the Silk Strike. The prosecutor called her<br>
a little agitator. Shame, said the judge; if she picketed again,<br>
he would ship her to the State Home for Girls in Trenton.</p>
<p>Hannah left the courthouse to picket the mill. She chased<br>
a strikebreaker down the street, yelling in Yidish the word<br>
for shame. Back in court, she hissed at the judge&rsquo;s sentence<br>
of another striker. Hannah got twenty days in jail for hissing.<br>
She sang all the way to jail. After the strike came the blacklist,<br>
the counter at her husband&rsquo;s candy store, the words for shame.</p>
<p><em>V. Vivas to Those Who Have Failed</em></p>
<p>Strikers without shoes lose strikes. Twenty years after the weavers<br>
and dyers&rsquo; helpers returned hollow-eyed to the loom and the steam,<br>
Mazziotti led the other silk mill workers marching down the avenue<br>
in Paterson, singing the old union songs for five cents more an hour.<br>
Once again the nightsticks cracked cheekbones like teacups.<br>
Mazziotti pressed both hands to his head, squeezing red ribbons<br>
from his scalp. There would be no buffalo nickel for an hour&rsquo;s work<br>
at the mill, for the silk of bow ties and scarves. Skull remembered wood.</p>
<p>The brain thrown against the wall of the skull remembered too:<br>
the Sons of Italy, the Workmen&rsquo;s Circle, Local 152, Industrial<br>
Workers of the World, one-eyed Big Bill and Flynn the Rebel Girl<br>
speaking in tongues to thousands the prophecy of an eight-hour day.<br>
Mazziotti&rsquo;s son would become a doctor, his daughter a poet.<br>
Vivas to those who have failed: for they become the river.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>&ldquo;Vivas to those who have failed: for they become the river.&quot;</em></strong><br>
I like how this piece re-contextualizes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1913_Paterson_silk_strike">1913 paterson silk strike</a> as, well, not a failure because they stood up and lay the foundation for what&rsquo;s to come; they <em>became the river</em>.
In order to succeed one must go through a lot of failure.
We take the 8-hour work day for granted now, but it definitely wasn&rsquo;t the case when this strike happened.
The rights we enjoy today can be directly correlated with their actions and as such it is important for us to remember.
Also the red imagery combined with all the stories [almost like a snapshot/diorama from the protest] is just so powerful.</p>
