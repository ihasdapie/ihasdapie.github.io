ECE286: Probability and Statistics Probability Coin flip example &amp;amp; combining probabilities Outcomes denoted by variables, i.e. for coin clip \( H \), \( T \). Probability of outcome is denoted by \( P(X) \), where \( X \) is the outcome. We must have \( \sum(P) = 1 \) since \( 100% \).

      <description>Exam &amp;lsquo;cheat sheets&amp;rsquo; for EngSci 2nd year semester fall semester. These were made as part of my own studying for the exams. As 3/6 of my exams were cancelled due to the omicron covid variant, AER210, MAT292, and PHY293 are missing.
I do not guarantee content correctness &amp;ndash; but if you find a mistake, please let me know!
CHE260 Note: the following only contains materials for the final exam, so it will only cover the heat-transfer portion of CHE260.</description>
