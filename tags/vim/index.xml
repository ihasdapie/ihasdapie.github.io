      <description>/* work in progress */
My first text editor was the one used in my highschool intro to cs class, geany &amp;ndash; which is a wonderful lightweight development environment &amp;ndash; and is, in my opinion, an excellent first editor because of its&amp;rsquo; simple yet powerful interface, cross-platform compatibility, and support for most relevant languages.
The Beginning But, at the time, my laptop was a 11.6&amp;quot; chromebook with 16GB of eMMC storage and kitted out with a CPU less capable than most budget modern phones.</description>

      <description>TLDR: you want code completions while working with ROS2
LSP with clangd ROS2 puts its headers into /opt/ros2/&amp;lt;ROS_DISTRO&amp;gt;/include. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work out of the box with my fairly default clangd setup, and it would be too easy if it just worked out of the box with vim! Most editors like vscode or clion have their own way of handling scenarios like this, e.g. vscode using a c_cpp_properties.json file.
For vscode setup, see this or this</description>
