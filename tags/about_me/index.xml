      <description>I spent summer 2022 interning at Open Robotics1, a non-profit organization that spawned 2 and maintains ROS, ROS2 (Robot Operating System) and the Gazebo simulator.&#xA;Since writing up an retrospective is a lot more work than I&amp;rsquo;d like to put in right now, here&amp;rsquo;s the output of gh search prs --involves ihasdapie -L 100 in the relevant ros orgs, if that&amp;rsquo;s of interest.

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;ndash; \( \LaTeX \)) is unequivocally cooler than Word. And you want an unequivocally cool resume. So you tried altacv, but it always got absolutely chewed up by ATS systems.&#xA;And so you yearned for a ðŸŒ coolðŸ¥¶ single-column layout, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one.&#xA;I present: my fork of altacv with a few ðŸŒŸ revolutionary ðŸŒŸ features.&#xA;Cut down on icons to improve pdf-to-text conversion Change to a single-column layout \itag{asdf} command to draw an inline &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; \chref command for hyperlinks Disabling word wrapping and hyphenation Various changes to \makecvevent, etc.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Brian And I&amp;rsquo;m an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Engineering and minoring in Robotics. While I&amp;rsquo;m not cramming for school I like to cook, play badminton, and sometimes build cool stuff like self-driving cars. Or, in more general terms: I convert bubble tea to spaghetti code1. I also occasionally write posts on my blog, so feel free to check that out too :)</description>
