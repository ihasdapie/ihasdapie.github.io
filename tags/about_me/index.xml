      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;ndash; \( \LaTeX \)) is unequivocally cooler than Word. And you want an unequivocally cool resume as well.
So you tried altacv, but it always got absolutely chewed up by ATS systems.
And so you yearned for a ðŸŒ coolðŸ¥¶ single-column layout, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one.
I present: my fork of altacv with a few ðŸŒŸ revolutionary ðŸŒŸ features.
Cut down on icons to improve pdf-to-text conversion Change to a single-column layout \itag{asdf} command to draw an inline &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; \chref command for hyperlinks Disabling word wrapping and hyphenation Various changes to \makecvevent, etc.</description>

      <description>What am I up to right now? Just wrapped an SWE internship @ Open Source Robotics Foundation, which was pretty cool because I got to work on ROS2 and Gazebo &amp;ndash; robotics libraries I deal with everyday at aUToronto. My main project was working on REP2012: Service Introspection, which is a standards-track REP &amp;amp; accompanying reference implementation which will &amp;ndash; after ~11 years &amp;ndash; finally let users run things like ros2 service echo or ros2 bag record --services1.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Brian and I&amp;rsquo;m a student, software-engineer-in-training1, and pokemon go enthusiast I&amp;rsquo;m an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto majoring in Computer Engineering. Outside of school, I&amp;rsquo;m passionate about making cool stuff like self-driving cars, while learning more about the world we live in. When I&amp;rsquo;m not cramming for school, I enjoy cooking and playing badminton.
While you&amp;rsquo;re here, why don&amp;rsquo;t you check out my about me page, or read more about some projects I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on?</description>
