      <description>I spent the past summer at Open Robotics, a non-profit organization that spawned 1 and maintains ROS, ROS2 (Robot Operating System) and the Gazebo simulator. I worked as a software engineering intern working largely on the ROS2 ecosystem
Figured you would want it in 3rd person.
Brian Chen is a 3rd year undergrad student at the University of Toronto studying Engineering Science with a major in Electrical and Computer Engineering. At school he helps lead aUToronto, UofT&amp;rsquo;s self-driving car team where he tries his best to help a car figure out how to drive themselves in the scary real-life world of roads and intersections filled with pedestrians and inconsistent signage.</description>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;ndash; \( \LaTeX \)) is unequivocally cooler than Word. And you want an unequivocally cool resume as well.
So you tried altacv, but it always got absolutely chewed up by ATS systems.
And so you yearned for a ðŸŒ coolðŸ¥¶ single-column layout, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one.
I present: my fork of altacv with a few ðŸŒŸ revolutionary ðŸŒŸ features.
Cut down on icons to improve pdf-to-text conversion Change to a single-column layout \itag{asdf} command to draw an inline &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; \chref command for hyperlinks Disabling word wrapping and hyphenation Various changes to \makecvevent, etc.</description>
