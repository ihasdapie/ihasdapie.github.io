      <description>Back when I was still on X11 1 , I had this little bash script to toggle my touchscreen on/off since I didn&amp;rsquo;t use it all that often except to sign the occasional PDF, and it sucked up power2.
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14  #!/usr/bin/bash  # toggles touchscreen on x11-based systems isOn=&amp;#34;$(xinput --list-props &amp;#39;SYNA2393:00 06CB:19AC&amp;#39; | grep &amp;#39;Device Enabled&amp;#39;)&amp;#34; isOn=&amp;#34;${isOn: -1}&amp;#34; if [ $isOn -eq 0 ]; then xinput set-prop &amp;#39;SYNA2393:00 06CB:19AC&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Device Enabled&amp;#39; 1 echo &amp;#34;Turning touchscreen on!</description>

      <description>A few weeks back one of my roommates mentioned in passing that they were thinking of writing conway&amp;rsquo;s game of life as a little widget for their website. I thought that was pretty fun and suggested that it would be really neat if it were in 3D as well.
&amp;hellip;Anyways fast-forward about two hours and I was stuck in a 3-hour lecture. So I wrote it (as is pretty evident below)</description>

      <description>Needed to use a Pi Pico for one of my courses (which mandated circuitpython &amp;hellip; for reasons unknown) and noticed that Adafruit&amp;rsquo;s documentation for using CircuitPython with something that wasn&amp;rsquo;t Mu Editor was not really up to par.
 Install CircuitPython by copying .uf2 file into the Pi Pico, which can be done by just plugging it into your computer python3 -m pip install circuitpython-stubs to get completions with your LSP of choice Connect to serial port to view prints and logging info   find the appropriate port with ls /dev/ttyACM* connect using GNU screen or whatever you like to use  e.</description>

      <title>Writing a resume with LaTeX</title>

      <description>Let&amp;rsquo;s face it &amp;ndash; \( \LaTeX \)) is unequivocally cooler than Word. And you want an unequivocally cool resume as well.
So you tried altacv, but it always got absolutely chewed up by ATS systems.
And so you yearned for a ðŸŒ coolðŸ¥¶ single-column layout, but you couldn&amp;rsquo;t find one.
I present: my fork of altacv with a few ðŸŒŸ revolutionary ðŸŒŸ features.
 Cut down on icons to improve pdf-to-text conversion Change to a single-column layout \itag{asdf} command to draw an inline &amp;ldquo;tag&amp;rdquo; \chref command for hyperlinks Disabling word wrapping and hyphenation Various changes to \makecvevent, etc.</description>

      <title>Using NeoVim for ROS2 c&#43;&#43; development</title>

      <description>Using clangd ROS2 puts its headers into a rather non-standard location, /opt/ros2/&amp;lt;ROS_DISTRO&amp;gt;/include. Obviously this doesn&amp;rsquo;t play well with standard clangd setups, and it would be too easy if it just worked out of the box with vim! Most editors like vscode or clion have their own way of handling scenarios like this, e.g. vscode using a c_cpp_properties.json file.
 For vscode setup, see this or this
 With vim this is as little uglier.</description>

      <description>This page will track some notes and TILs for AoC2021, which I will be completing in rust &amp;ndash; a language I am still learning.
Solutions are hosted here. If a day isn&amp;rsquo;t very interesting, I won&amp;rsquo;t post a writeup for it.
Day 6 Problem Solution
So many lanternfish! The key to this puzzle is to represent the lanternfish as a histogram rather than creating a list of all the lanternfish. See solution.</description>
