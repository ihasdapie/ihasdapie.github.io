      <description>A few weeks back one of my roommates mentioned in passing that they were thinking of writing conway&amp;rsquo;s game of life as a little widget for their website. I thought that was pretty fun and suggested that it would be really neat if it were in 3D as well.
&amp;hellip; anyways fast-forward about two hours and I was stuck in a 3-hour lecture. So I wrote it (as is pretty evident below)</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;The only three rules an engineer needs to learn and remember&amp;rdquo; \( F = ma \) You can&amp;rsquo;t push on a rope. To get the answer, you must first know the answer Michael P. Collins
This, and an appreciation for elegant design (and the various types concrete aggregates used in the pantheon) is what has stuck from when I took CIV102. We were fortunate enough to be the last cohort to take it under Prof.</description>

      <description>Making it a commitment for 2022 to read some poems.
The Jackdaw source
William Cowper
There is a bird who, by his coat
And by the hoarseness of his note,
Might be supposed a crow;
A great frequenter of the church,
Where, bishop-like, he finds a perch,
And dormitory too.
Above the steeple shines a plate,
That turns and turns, to indicate
From what point blows the weather.
Look up &amp;ndash; your brains begin to swim,</description>
